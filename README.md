I have created an attandance application using the stringIO package and for the frontend we used the streamlit package. The entire application is build in python. I have tried using an LLMs for this attendance application but due to the dataset I can't able to add an AI in this application because it is small. The entire code is below and also i have uploaded the file. In future if i have a real time attandance data. I can leverage the LLMs and create an application similarly like this.
